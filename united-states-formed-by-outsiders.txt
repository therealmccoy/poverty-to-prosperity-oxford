QUE: Think of an example where a country succeeded or failed in any of the six steps discussed in this module.

United States in it's present avatar is mostly an immigrant based society, both in the labour as well as knowledge domain.

But if we really look around, the most powerful country of the world is completely built by outsiders and the native had hardly any hand it it, ie the Red Indians or the Indians as we might call them.

The foreigners killed and displaced the Indians, over-powered them, ran them over and then they start bringing over slaves form Africa to cultivate the vast farm lands and the story goes on. They thus succeeded in the "economies of scale of violence".

Red Indians had their own sort of centralised structure, but it broke down due to the onslaught of invaders, which caused anarchy and formation of a new centralised structure based on colonialism.
